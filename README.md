# PPL---125L-Project

This repository is a trial run for the 125L PPL project.

This workspace is used to validate setup, tooling, and basic project workflows for the Pilot Project Lab (PPL) 125L. It contains experimental code, notes, and small tests to confirm that builds, runs, and integrations work correctly in the dev container (Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS). Expect frequent changes — not for production use.

Goals:
- Verify development environment and container setup.
- Test core build/run workflows and sample data.
- Capture initial findings and next steps.
