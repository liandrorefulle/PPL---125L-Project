        "\n",
        "An **interpreter system** is a program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them to be compiled into machine code first. This process involves reading source code, analyzing it (lexing and parsing), and then executing the commands to produce a result. Interpreters are vital in environments requiring high portability, rapid prototyping, and dynamic execution, such as command shells, scripting languages (like Python or JavaScript), and specialized domain-specific languages (DSLs).\n",

The project was selected to provide a practical, hands-on understanding of the fundamental phases of interpreter design: **Lexical Analysis (Lexer), Syntactic Analysis (Parser), and Execution (Executor)**. The target task is the sequential evaluation and execution of statements written in the custom language, including mathematical calculations, conditional logic, and iterative control structures."

Its design rationale is to mimic the structure of high-level scripting languages while enforcing explicit data types to reduce runtime ambiguity.\n",

        "#### **Overview of Interpreter Architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "The PPL-Script interpreter follows the classic three-stage architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Lexer (Tokenizer):** Converts the input text (source code) into a linear sequence of recognized tokens.\n",
        "2.  **Parser:** Takes the token stream and organizes it into a structured command representation (a dictionary/Abstract Syntax Tree proxy) that reflects the language's grammar.\n",
        "3.  **Executor (Interpreter Engine):** Executes the structured commands by manipulating program state (the `variables` dictionary) and performing I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Data Flow Diagram**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data flow is sequential and iterative for each line of code:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input (Source Code Line) → Tokenization (Lexer) → Parsing (Command Structure) → Execution (Executor) → Output/State Change**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Input:** A single line of PPL-Script is read from the source file.\n",
        "2.  **Tokenization:** The `tokenize` function removes comments and uses regular expressions to capture distinct meaningful units (e.g., keywords, operators, values, variable names).\n",
        "3.  **Parsing:** The `parse` function identifies the command type based on keywords (e.g., `print`, `read`) or structural elements (e.g., `=`). It generates a dictionary (`command`) containing the command and its arguments (`cmd`, `name`, `value`, `condition`, etc.).\n",
        "4.  **Execution:** The `execute` function or the main `run` loop processes the `command` dictionary. Simple commands are executed directly, while control flow commands (`if`, `while`, `repeat`) manage the program counter (`i`) and delegate block execution to `run_block`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Error Handling Strategies**\n",
        "\n",
        "The interpreter employs two primary error handling mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **File/Setup Errors:** The `run` function includes a `try-except` block to catch `FileNotFoundError` for the program file and handles command-line argument validation (`sys.argv` check).\n",
        "2.  **Runtime/Syntax Errors:** A broad `try-except Exception as e` is used within the main loop of `run` to catch any error during tokenization, parsing, or execution, providing a message including the line number (`Error at line {i+1}: {e}`). Explicit **syntax validation** is performed within the `parse` and `evaluate` functions using `raise ValueError` for known invalid patterns (e.g., in `read` statement syntax or during expression evaluation).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Design Justification (Critical Consideration)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The interpreter uses a **keyword-based, top-down parsing method** implemented via sequential `if/elif` statements in the `parse` function. This approach is justified because:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Simplicity and Speed:** For a simple DSL with a limited grammar, this non-formal parsing method is fast to implement and easy to maintain.\n",
        "* **Delegated Complexity:** The most complex part—mathematical and logical expression evaluation—is **delegated** to Python's built-in `eval()` function after pre-processing (variable substitution and operator translation). This saves significant development time by avoiding the need to write a full expression parser."

The implementation demonstrates **robustness** primarily through its dedicated error-handling strategy within the `run` and `evaluate` functions. By using `try-except` blocks and performing explicit syntax validation for specific commands, the interpreter provides clear, contextualized error messages instead of failing unexpectedly."

        "\n",
        "Document any features added beyond the basic requirements. These extensions enhance the PPL-Script language, improving its usefulness and complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Explicit Variable Typing**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Description:** Variables must be declared with an explicit type annotation, such as `(int)`, `(deci)` (float), or `(bool)`, unless they are assigned a string literal.\n",
        "* **Implementation Detail:**\n",
        "    * The `parse` function uses `re.match` to capture the type from the variable declaration string.\n",
        "    * The `execute` function then performs explicit type casting (`int()`, `float()`) on the resulting value for both `assign` and `read` commands.\n",
        "* **Improvement to Usefulness:** This enforces **data integrity** and reduces implicit type conversion errors, which are common issues in dynamically-typed scripting languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Full Conditional Structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Description:** The language supports comprehensive branching logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks, all clearly delimited and terminated by the `done` keyword.\n",
        "* **Implementation Detail:** The main `run` loop contains sophisticated logic to identify the boundaries of the entire conditional block. Once an initial `if` or `elif` condition is successfully executed, the interpreter is designed to **skip over any remaining `elif` and `else` lines** until it reaches the corresponding `done` keyword.\n",
        "* **Improvement to Usefulness:** This provides **essential flow control** capability for creating complex decision-making processes, mirroring standard high-level languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Iterative `repeat` Loop with Counter**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Description:** This extension introduces a convenient counted loop construct that runs a block a fixed number of times (`repeat 3:`). It includes an advanced variant that exposes an iterator variable (`repeat 3 as i:`).\n",
        "* **Implementation Detail:** The `run` function uses a Python `for` loop to execute the code block lines. For the `repeat_as` extension, it temporarily writes the iteration index (`idx`) to the global `variables` dictionary using the specified loop variable name (`as_var`) before running the block.\n",
        "* **Improvement to Usefulness:** This simplifies **finite iteration tasks** and provides an easily accessible loop counter without the need for manual counter variable setup, initialization, and incrementing required by a `while` loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Extended Arithmetic Operators**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Description:** The arithmetic capabilities are extended to include the Modulo (`%`) and Exponentiation (`^`) operators.\n",
        "* **Implementation Detail:** The `evaluate` function handles the exponentiation operator by translating the PPL-Script symbol (`^`) to Python's valid operator (`**`) just before the expression is processed by `eval()`.\n",
        "* **Improvement to Usefulness:** This enhances the language's utility for **complex mathematical and numerical computation** beyond basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."

        "# Section 8. Insights and Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Summary of Learnings**\n",
        "\n",
        "The project successfully delivered a functional custom scripting language interpreter, providing deep, practical insight into the lifecycle of program execution. We learned that the process can be fundamentally broken down into three well-defined stages: Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, and Execution. The most critical conceptual takeaway was the decision to **delegate the complex task of expression evaluation** to the host language's built-in `eval()` function, which dramatically reduced the need to manually code operator precedence and arithmetic logic within the Executor.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Strengths of the Interpreter Design**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clear Modularity:** The strict separation of concerns into distinct functions (`tokenize`, `parse`, `execute`, `evaluate`) promotes code readability, maintainability, and ease of debugging.\n",
        "2.  **Robust Flow Control:** The implementation successfully handles complex procedural logic, including nested `if-elif-else` structures and extended iterative loops (`while`, `repeat as i`).\n",
        "3.  **Effective Error Reporting:** The main `run` loop uses generalized exception handling to report runtime errors with the corresponding line number, providing crucial context for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Limitations and Future Improvement**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Critical Limitation: Reliance on `eval()`:** The heavy reliance on Python's `eval()` for executing arbitrary expressions represents a significant security and design flaw. In a non-toy environment, `eval()` could be exploited to run unauthorized code.\n",
        "    * **Future Improvement:** This must be replaced with a **custom Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) evaluation mechanism** (e.g., AST walker) to completely control the execution environment and eliminate security risks.\n",
        "2.  **Global Scoping:** The current interpreter lacks support for functions and local variables, as all variables are stored in a single global dictionary (`variables`).\n",
        "    * **Future Improvement:** Implement a symbol table and stack-based approach to manage **local variable scoping** for function support.\n",
        "3.  **Limited Type Error Handling:** While explicit typing is required, the actual handling of type mismatch errors (e.g., attempting to add an integer to a boolean) is mostly delegated to Python's runtime errors rather than custom, user-friendly type checking messages.\n",
        "    * **Future Improvement:** Implement dedicated logic within the `execute` function to validate type compatibility during assignment and arithmetic operations before calling `evaluate`."
